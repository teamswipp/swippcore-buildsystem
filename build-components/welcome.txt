This build system allows you to build the core Swipp wallet for
a number of operating systems and flavours. The build system is
continously updated and integrated alongside new versions of the
Swipp wallet.

While it's not entirely clear, the Linux flavour not only builds
native versions for the underlying Linux distribution, but also
creates distribution independent binaries in the form of
AppImages.
